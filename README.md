<p>Abstract: In this document I will state how I think classroom and school culture should present for students. School should always be a positive and encouraging place that students feel safe and welcome in. That will translate to my own classroom culture, where my students and I have mutual respect. I believe that students are motivated more when they know their teacher cares and respects them; I have evidence of that from observations in multiple schools and my own working experience as a gymnastics instructor. My classroom culture will be playful and fun, yet professional and focused on student achievement and learning.</p>

<h4>In my future classroom:</h4>
<u1>
	<li>Students can always ask questions </li>
	<li>They respect me but also can joke and be friendly</li>
	<li>Students will respect me if I respect them</li>
	<li>Classroom filled with student work</li>
	<li>I look for improvement, not perfection </li>
	<li>Students know when I am joking and when I am serious (facial expression)</li>
	<li>I can joke around with them </li>
	<li>I will ask for preferred pronouns</li>
	<li>Group work or partner work a lot</li>	
	<li>USE A TIMER</li>
</u1></p>
<p>
<h4>Design Plan:</h4>

	<h5>Before School Starts:</h5>
	<u3>
		<li>Put up poster of classroom expectations in bright colors so it is easily noticeable and readable</li>
		<li>Move desks around according to the classroom so I can easily get near every student if need be</li>
		<li>Ask administration what consequences I am allowed to give (and what I’m not allowed to do as well)</li>
	</u3>
	<h5>First Day with Students:</h5>
	<u4>
		<li>Point out expectations poster</li>
		<li>If students test me, stay calm and consistent</li>
		<li>Multitude of classroom management strategies:</li>
		<u5>
			<li>Wait time</li>
			<li>Counting down </li>
			<li>Timer </li>
			<li>Proximity </li>
			<li>Warning and then consequence </li>
			<li>Flicking the lights </li>
			<li>Talking quietly (if students aren’t too loud to somewhat hear me, so they get quiet in order to hear what I have to say)</li>
			<li>Telling a story to get their attention: Plan out story ahead of time so I can determine if it will distract them or not</li>
			<li>Having a certain name for them to get their attention (give the class a mascot or something: “Okay, Tigers!”)</li>
			<li>I think a classroom management strategy could be for me to show the students I respect them in some way.  If they know I respect them, they are more likely to respect me</li>
			<li>“When I say [blank], you can go [do something]” Make the students wait for me to say that so I have their attention for instruction</li>
			<li>Repeat instruction at least once so students know if they weren’t paying attention the first time</li<
			<li>3 strikes you’re out </li>
			<li>Names on the board (don’t say anything about it, just write them) then students will pay more attention to me</li>
			<li>Reward for participation</li>
		</u5>
		<li>Whatever strategies I use, I should stay relatively consistent with that as well, so students know what’s happening</li>

<h3 align="center">InTASC 3 Reflection</h3>
<p>The culture of a school is an important part of a student’s life. If students are kept in a positive, upbeat environment, it will reflect in both academics and activities outside of school. Classroom culture is imperative in the environment of the school. Teachers can create a culture in their classrooms in which students feel safe and welcome, and that culture can spread through the whole school as well. In the classroom, students should be able to earn the respect of the teacher, and the teacher should earn respect from the students. It is important for a teacher to have authority, but as a student it is important that good student teacher relationships follow with engagement, interest, and motivation. If a classroom is full of meaningful student teacher relationships and mutual respect, then many classroom management problems vanish. Students want to do well if they feel encouraged and respected by their teachers. A beneficial learning environment will help student growth individually and academically, especially if the culture is carried out throughout the school. </p>
<p>Respect and culture can be planned by teachers. Teachers can lay out ground rules and expectations in the first week of school, and those expectations can reflect the culture of both the classroom and the school. A way to gain respect from the students would be to have a set of expectations the teacher brings, such as listening and paying attention; no cell phones; no horseplay; and others. But students can also make their own classroom rules and expectations for themselves and the teacher. They can make anchor charts or posters and the teacher can hang them in the classroom as a reminder to all. If the students feel included in making rules instead of just being told to follow them, they will adhere to them more. Building student teacher relationships can be planned as well; teachers can make goals for building relationships for each day or week by doing simple things such as asking what students did over the weekend, making observations during and outside of class, and going to extracurricular activities. This relationship should be somewhat friendly and fun but a teacher always need to make it clear that they are in charge; teachers must stay professional. Intentional goals and planning builds respect in the classroom and creates a culture of learning and achievement in both the classroom and the school. </p>
<p>Ideas I have for my future classroom to build this culture of learning and achievement are student-teacher relationships and mutual respect, as I said above. I am good at learning and remembering names, so I will begin memorizing them as soon as school starts with the goal of having everyone by the end of the second week. Addressing students by name when they enter and leave the classroom is a great sign of respect. I will also have students fill out a paper so I can learn more about them; this will include hobbies, nicknames, personal pronouns, and contact information. On the very first day of school, I will have a poster made of yellow or another bright color, with a list of my expectations on it. During class I will project my computer and ask students what they’re expectations are for themselves and for me. I will type these out as students say them so that there are no overlaps, and I will make a new word document for each class so that students feel like they are truly coming up with the ideas, that they are included in the decision making process. Another way I will promote my classroom culture is by interacting with parents. When teachers call, it is usually about a problem; but as a teacher I will also call or email parents when something positive happens, that way they also know I care for their children. I also plan on interacting with students in a professional but playful manner, much like I do others in my life. I truly believe that if students notice my normal interactions with them, they will respect me more because it is evident that I am treating them like a person, not a little child. I have evidence of this fact from my previous years a gymnastics instructor and I will continue to do so in my future classroom. </p>
<p>A classroom culture that is inviting and playful is important for students to feel welcome and included. As a student I saw evidence of that, and as a teacher I do as well. When a student is in a good environment, they are more motivated to learn and grow. These cultures can be planned out in a school and a classroom, and it may take effort but it will all be worth it for the students that come into my classroom ready to learn. </p>
